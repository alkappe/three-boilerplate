# three-boilerplate
A modern boilerplate for three.js projects ðŸŽ‰

I whipped this up as a convenient starting point that will make three.js and shader development easier.  Clone and you're ready to go with webpack, babel, GLSLify, a hot reloading dev server and a basic three.js scene including some extremely basic GLSLified shaders.

## Features
* Three.js
* GLSLify for easy shader development
* GSAP for easy animation
* Babel for nice ES6+ stuff
* Builds with webpack
* Hot reloading dev server

## Usage
* `npm run start` => fires up the dev server and watches files for changes
* `npm run build` => normal build
* `npm run build-simple` => includes three.js from cdnjs, doesn't transpile. Great for Codepen.

## Future
* Turn it into a CLI since that's a thing people do now
